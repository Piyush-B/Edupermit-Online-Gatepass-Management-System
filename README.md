EduPermit - Online Gatepass Management System
EduPermit is a streamlined online gatepass application designed to simplify the permission process for students in educational institutions. It eliminates the need for manual permission slips and physical signatures by introducing a three-way interface:

-> Admin Portal â€“ Admins (HODs, Principals, or authorized staff) can review, approve, or reject student requests digitally.
-> Gatekeeper Portal â€“ Gatekeepers can verify approved passes instantly, ensuring a smooth and secure exit process.

Key Features :
âœ… Digital Permission Workflow â€“ No more paperwork or physical signatures.
âœ… Real-time Request Status â€“ Students receive instant updates on approval/rejection.
âœ… Role-Based Access Control â€“ Secure and structured access for different users.
âœ… History & Logs â€“ Track all approvals, rejections, and student movements.
âœ… Mobile & Web-Friendly â€“ Accessible from any device for convenience.

EduPermit enhances efficiency, reduces administrative burden, and ensures a secure, transparent process for student movement. ðŸš€âœ¨
